## HTTP Request Metrics

### vl_http_requests_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `path`: `/select/logsql/query`, `/insert/jsonline`, `/insert/loki/api/v1/push`, etc.
- `format`: `json`, `protobuf`
**Description:** HTTP requests arriving at VictoriaLogs endpoints. Counts all requests immediately when received, before any validation or authentication happens.

### vl_http_errors_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `path`: endpoint path
- `reason`: `wrong_basic_auth`, `wrong_auth_key`, `unsupported`
**Description:** Failed HTTP requests due to client errors or data problems. Counts authentication failures, unsupported content types, parameter errors, and cases where request data cannot be parsed (like malformed JSON or invalid log formats).

### vl_http_request_duration_seconds
**Type:** Summary
**Labels:**
- `path`: endpoint path
**Description:** Complete time spent processing each HTTP request from start to finish. Includes all processing steps: parsing request data, validating parameters, storing logs, and sending responses. Captured when requests complete successfully.

### vl_http_request_errors_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `path`: endpoint path
**Description:** Failed request processing in internal cluster endpoints (`/internal/select/*`). Currently only tracks errors for cluster communication endpoints, not public API endpoints like `/select/logsql/query` or `/insert/jsonline`.

## Data Ingestion Metrics

### vl_rows_ingested_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: `jsonline`, `loki`, `elasticsearch`, `datadog`, `opentelemetry`, `journald`, `syslog`
**Description:** Log entries successfully parsed and added to the processing pipeline. Counts all entries that pass initial validation, including debug entries that are processed but not stored when `debug=1` is used.

### vl_bytes_ingested_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: ingestion protocol
**Description:** Estimated JSON size of ingested log entry fields. Calculated using field name lengths and values to provide consistent volume measurement across different input formats like JSON, Loki, or syslog.

### vl_rows_dropped_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `reason`: `debug`, `too_many_fields`, `too_big_timestamp`, `too_small_timestamp`
**Description:** Log entries rejected for specific reasons. `debug` counts entries processed with `debug=1` (parsed but not stored). `too_many_fields` counts entries exceeding `-insert.maxFieldsPerLine`. `too_small_timestamp` counts entries older than `-retentionPeriod`. `too_big_timestamp` counts entries newer than `-futureRetention`.

### vl_insert_flush_duration_seconds
**Type:** Summary
**Labels:**
- `type`: ingestion protocol
**Description:** Time taken to flush accumulated logs from memory buffers to storage. Triggered when buffers fill up or during periodic flushes (every ~1 second with jitter). High values suggest storage bottlenecks or slow disk performance.

### vl_too_long_lines_skipped_total
**Type:** Counter
**Description:** Log lines exceeding `-insert.maxLineSizeBytes` (default 256KB) during parsing. Lines are skipped to prevent memory exhaustion. Indicates malformed data, overly verbose logs, or need to increase the size limit.

## Storage System Metrics

### vl_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage`, `indexdb`
**Description:** Current disk space used by log data and indexes. `storage` shows compressed log data across all storage tiers (inmemory + small + big parts). `indexdb` shows space used by search indexes for stream fields and log filtering.

### vl_compressed_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`
**Description:** Actual compressed size of log data in each storage tier. `inmemory` holds recently ingested data in RAM. `small` contains small parts on disk (typically from recent flushes). `big` contains merged large parts on disk for long-term storage.

### vl_uncompressed_data_size_bytes
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`
**Description:** Original uncompressed size of log data in each storage tier before compression. Compare with compressed size to calculate compression ratios and understand storage efficiency across different tiers.

### vl_storage_rows
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**

**Description:** Number of log entries in each storage tier. Shows data distribution: `inmemory` has fresh logs not yet written to disk, `small` has recently flushed data, `big` has data from completed merge operations.

### vl_storage_parts
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: storage tier
**Description:** Number of storage parts (data files) in each tier. More parts mean fragmentation; fewer parts suggest successful merging. High part counts may slow queries and trigger background merge operations.

### vl_storage_blocks
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: storage tier
**Description:** Number of data blocks within storage parts. Blocks are the smallest units of compressed data storage. Higher block counts within parts mean more granular data organization.

### vl_pending_rows
**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage`, `indexdb`
**Description:** Log entries waiting in memory buffers before being written to disk. `storage` counts log data awaiting flush. `indexdb` counts index entries awaiting flush. High values suggest ingestion rate exceeds storage write speed.

### vl_partitions
**Type:** Gauge
**Description:** Number of daily partitions currently active in storage. Each partition typically represents one day of log data. Count decreases when old partitions are deleted due to retention policies.

## Merge Operation Metrics

### vl_merge_duration_seconds
**Type:** Summary
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`, `indexdb/inmemory`, `indexdb/file`
**Description:** Time spent merging storage parts to optimize storage layout and query performance. Background mergers automatically trigger when parts accumulate in each tier. `inmemory` tracks flushing buffered logs to disk, `small` tracks merging recently written files, `big` tracks merging large files for long-term storage.

**Type:** Gauge
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`, `indexdb/inmemory`, `indexdb/file`

### vl_merges_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**
- `type`: `storage/inmemory`, `storage/small`, `storage/big`, `indexdb/inmemory`, `indexdb/file`
**Description:** Total completed merge operations since startup. Background mergers consolidate parts to reduce fragmentation and improve query performance. Higher rates suggest active data ingestion and normal storage optimization.

### vl_rows_merged_total
**Type:** Counter
**Labels:**

See also [`vl_storage_per_query_processed_rows`](#vl_storage_per_query_processed_rows).

### vl_storage_per_query_processed_rows

See also [`vl_storage_per_query_processed_blocks`](#vl_storage_per_query_processed_blocks).

### vl_storage_per_query_read_values
